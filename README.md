This has been created by hands (not generated cause i liked to copy/paste much lol) it's from the PSX SDK,
it's only for information purpose for how it should look, including drawing room, sounds,AI and many structure.

The purpose is that if you have reversed the tomb raider 5 Engine on the PC Version you could refer to the current structure,
for exemple if you find where is the function of the "STATS" then you will know how it look and the same apply for the entire SaveGame.

You are free to use or post anything you want even to make your own wiki but be sure to credit this github if you use it at all,
Thank You and if you want you can just save that .cpp and open it in Visual Studio for the NICE colored code.
